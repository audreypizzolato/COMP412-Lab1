Testing Conformance	(If we got this far, the tar file worked.)

	Produced 'ERROR' message on missing or bad file name
	Help message check found all options

Quick Scalability Test:
	(For a more accurate test, run the auto-timer)

	T8k.i:  	1.144566 seconds
	T16k.i:  	1.165827 seconds
	T32k.i:  	1.198539 seconds
	T64k.i:  	1.085941 seconds
	T128k.i:  	1.508811 seconds

	The code may not work; 2 codes showed minimal growth
	This effect may also be timer variability.
	Run the auto-timer to see more accurate results.

	Scaling appears to be linear.

Scoring (on the provided test blocks):

	Correctness:	43.75%
	Conformance:	100.0%

	Run the auto-timer to see Scalability results
